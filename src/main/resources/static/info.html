/Brad Pitt, Bullet train/

- Really? You don't remember me?
- You look like every white homeless man I've ever seen.
- You shot me!
- I shoot a lot of people.
- You shot me twice!
- Well, you also have a shootable face.

- Think you are right about one thing...
- Usually am.

- I just want to celebrate another day of life!

/Bullet train/

- All is well! Never better! Oh, what sweet libation is this? Is it... poison, by any chance?

Y'Shtola, FFXIV
